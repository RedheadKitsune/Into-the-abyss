Section 1(a) - Dice Testing  - Not for release 

Test rolling is an action out of world applying to one die roll. Understand "dice [die roll]" as test rolling. Carry out test rolling: say "Goddess of fate rolls dice,"; let the total thrown be the roll of the die roll understood; say "making [total thrown in words]."

Understand "dice" as a mistake ("You need to specify dice combination to roll. Try something like 3d6+2").
